# Minecraft-ComputerCraft-Scripts

Hello there! 

All these scripts were made for Computer Craft for different modpacks and you are free to use them as you wish.

Q&A:

**Q:** Why is the code for FTB Infinity Evolved very similar to All The Mods 6 code? 
**A:** In FTB the reactor mod is called BigReactors and the mod hasn't been updated since. In ATM6 there is a similar mod called BiggerReactors and the computer port API displays Max RF Amount in percentage rather then actual RF count.
